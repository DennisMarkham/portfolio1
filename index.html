<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="my face">

<p>My name is Dennis Markham.  I am in this class because I could not get a job in coding with my NCC certificate. 
This class is my one ticket out of loserdom so I hope I pass.  I am almost 28 and terribly ashamed of how little I've
accomplished in my life.</p>
<p>Other than that...ummm...I grew up in Connecticut, and moved here to Texas in the beginning of Summer 2017, right after getting
a programming certificate for Norwalk Community College, or NCC.  But no one would hire me, so I decided I needed a more hardcore education.</p>
